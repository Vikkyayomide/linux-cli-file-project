# 🖥️ Linux CLI File Management Project

This project was done as part of my **ALX Software Engineering journey**.

### ✅ What I did:
- Created and organized files like `todo_list`, `assignment`, `dream_cars`
- Built folders: `projects`, `plans`, `personal`
- Renamed typo: `futuer_list → future_list`
- Moved all `todo_*` files into `/home/plans`
- Deleted a duplicate file inside `to_be_deleted`
